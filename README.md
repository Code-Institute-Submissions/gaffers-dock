# GAFFERS' DOCK
    
    This is a website for a rigging company specialised in making and maintaining riggings for gaff rigged boats.
    
        The idea derives from the experiance of having renovated my own gaff rigged boat.
    When working with the rig, I found it difficult to find adiquate information and the proffesional help that I needed.
    A company like Gaffers' Dock (preferably in a nearby locaton) would have been greatly apreciated.

        Gaffers' Dock is an old family owned company with long experience of working with traditional crafts.
    Despite the fact that there aren’t many companies left, these days, with the skills and the knowhow of making
    and maintaining gaff rigs, the owner's feel the need to reach out to their potential customers
    with the means of a website. The aim being to increase order intake, share their knowledge and experiance
    and to make it easier for the boat owners to find their way to a professional traditional boat rigger.

        The owners of gaff rigged boats are known to have a soft spot for the romantic sides boat life.
    They quite often have a good eye for aesthetics, are generaly keen on traditional methods and materials,and...
    they love the smell of good old Stockholm tar.

        The website will adhere to those attributes in its fonts, images and colours etc. (perhaps without the smell of tar)
    in order to capture an ambiance of a marine environment set in the early 20th century.

## UX
        The existing hemp servicing on the wires in "Thalassa's" rig is now old and withered. 
    The owner plans to do the job herself, but, she wants to use modern material instead of hemp this time.
    She uses the web to try to find out what to use. Browsing, she comes across the Gaffers' Dock landing site,
    where she can get a free phone consultation, and, she clicks the "Call Us" button.

        The owner of "Vanessa" is skimming the web to find someone who can construct a complete new rig.
    He finds the website of Gaffers' Dock and gets intrigued by the vintage styled images.
    He, therefor, stays on the site to find out more about the company.
    Persuaded by the ongoing projects images, together with the company's history and skills,
    he clicks the "Queries" button to fills in the contact form.
